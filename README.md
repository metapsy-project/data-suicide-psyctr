The `data-suicide-psyctr` dataset is a meta-analytic research domain [MARD](https://docs.metapsy.org/uploads/ebmental-2022-300509.pdf)) on psychotherapy for suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. This MARD is part of the  [Metapsy project](https://www.metapsy.org/). The dataset contains study information and effect size data of trials that report the effect of psychotherapy on suicidal ideation, suicide attempts (including self-harm leading to hospitalisation) or completed suicides. This dataset includes psychotherapy vs. control ('psy vs ctr') comparisons. Effect sizes are provided for outcomes at post-test. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are different outcomes and are analysed separately.

The dataset follows the [Metapsy data standard](https://docs.metapsy.org/data-preparation/format/). All included information has been independently extracted two researchers. Risk of bias ratings were conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool (Version 2).
